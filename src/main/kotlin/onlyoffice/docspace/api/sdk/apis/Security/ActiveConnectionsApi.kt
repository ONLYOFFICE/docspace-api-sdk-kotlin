     * GET api/2.0/security/activeconnections
     * Get active connections
     * Lists the connections the calling user currently has open on this portal - one item per successful sign-in  that is still active - so a client can show where the account is signed in and close what does not belong  there. Any signed-in user may call it, nothing has to be called first, and the answer always covers the caller  alone: the operation is read-only, idempotent and cannot show another user's connections. Items cover the last  year and are ordered newest sign-in first, with the caller's own connection moved to the top and its browser,  platform, IP address and location refreshed from the current request. `loginEvent` is the ID of that own  connection and is `0` when the request was authenticated with a token in the `Authorization` header instead of  the portal cookie; nothing is then marked as current, and a user with no stored connections gets a single item  describing the current request. `country` and `city` are resolved from the IP address and stay empty when it  cannot be located. Pass an item's `id` to `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logout/{loginEventId}` to  end that one connection.
     * Responses:
     *  - 200: The caller's active connections, newest sign-in first, with `loginEvent` pointing at the connection the request itself was made with
     *  - 401: Unauthorized
     *  - 429: Too Many Requests.
     *  - 500: Internal Server Error.
     *  - 502: Bad Gateway. Returned by the reverse proxy, response body may be HTML and not JSON.

     * Closes one active connection: the sign-in behind `loginEventId` is marked inactive, the token and cookie tied  to it stop working, the client holding it is disconnected and a logout entry is written to the portal audit  trail. Take `loginEventId` from the `id` of an item of `GET api/2.0/security/activeconnections`, which also  reports in `loginEvent` which connection the caller is using, so a client can avoid closing its own. A user  may close their own connections, while closing somebody else's requires a DocSpace administrator and any other  caller is refused with 403. The call is mutating, destructive for that one session and idempotent, and it  leaves every other connection of the user alone - `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutallexceptthis`  is the way to close the rest in one go. Only `true` means the connection was open and has just been closed;  `false` comes back when this portal has no such active connection, including one that was already closed, and  after any other failure.
     * Responses:
     *  - 200: `true` when the connection was open and has been closed, `false` when this portal has no such active connection or the attempt failed
     *  - 403: The caller is not a DocSpace administrator and the connection belongs to another user

     * PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutallchangepassword
     * Log out and reset password
     * Closes every active connection of the calling user and returns the link that user has to open to set a new  password - the answer to a suspicious sign-in seen in `GET api/2.0/security/activeconnections`. Any signed-in  user may call it for their own account and nothing has to be called first; the same clean-up for somebody else  is `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutall/{userId}`. The call is mutating and destructive for  sessions - every token and cookie issued to the user before it stops working and the clients holding them are  disconnected - and it is not idempotent: the request is written to the portal audit trail, which invalidates  the link any earlier call returned, and the caller's own client is handed a fresh cookie in the response and  stays signed in through a new connection. The password itself is not changed here, and the link is handed back  to the caller rather than mailed to the user: the URL carries a time-limited `PasswordChange` key, which the  confirmation page it opens - or `PUT api/2.0/people/{userid}/password` - needs to accept the new password. A  failure is swallowed instead of reported, so an empty body with status 200 means nothing was done and the call  has to be repeated.

Nothing has to be called first; `userId` is the portal user ID  that `GET api/2.0/people` returns. A user may pass their own ID, while ending somebody else's connections  requires a DocSpace administrator and any other caller is refused with 403. The call is mutating, destructive  for those sessions and idempotent - a user with nothing open is not an error - and it returns no content, so  the state afterwards is read from `GET api/2.0/security/activeconnections`. A caller who ends their own  connections is handed a fresh cookie in the response and stays signed in through a new connection. Nothing  else about the user changes: the account stays enabled and the password stays valid, and to keep the current  connection alive instead use `PUT api/2.0/security/activeconnections/logoutallexceptthis`.
     * Responses:

Any signed-in user may call it for  their own account and nothing has to be called first. The connection to keep is the one behind the portal  authentication cookie: a request authenticated with a token in the `Authorization` header has none, and then  every connection of the user is closed, including the one that token belongs to - read `loginEvent` from  `GET api/2.0/security/activeconnections` first to see which connection, if any, will survive. The call is  mutating and destructive for the other sessions, and idempotent: the tokens behind them stop working, their  clients are disconnected at once and a logout entry is written to the portal audit trail. It answers with the  display name of the calling user, while an empty answer with status 200 means the attempt failed and nothing  can be assumed about what was closed.
