Any authenticated user may call it; no administrator permission is  required, and a portal whose payment has lapsed is served as well. The call is read-only and idempotent.

The values are installation-wide, so every portal of a server installation reports the same ones. The  response is revalidatable: it carries `Last-Modified`, and sending that value back in `If-Modified-Since`  yields an empty body while the details have not changed, which makes polling cheap.

Requires a DocSpace administrator. The call is read-only and idempotent. The answer is `true` only when both  conditions hold: the branding section is not switched off in the installation configuration, and the portal's  current plan includes customization. It comes back as `false` on a plan without branding, which is exactly the  case in which `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/save`,  `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/savefromfiles` and `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/save`  are refused as payment required. The restore operations do not depend on this flag and stay available, so a  portal that loses branding can still be reset to the built-in logos and wordmark. The flag says nothing about  the installation-wide default branding, which additionally needs a server installation with unrestricted space  access, and nothing about the company details and help links under `api/2.0/settings/rebranding`.

Requires a DocSpace  administrator. The call is read-only and idempotent. The answer has the same shape as one entry of  `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/isdefault`, with `name` fixed to `logotext` and `default` set to `true`  while no text has been stored and to `false` once one has. Because `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext`  falls back to `ONLYOFFICE` when nothing is stored, this operation is the only way to tell a portal that  deliberately kept the built-in wordmark from one that saved the very same text. Pass `isDefault=true` to  inspect the installation-wide default branding instead of this portal's. The flag turns back to `true` after  `PUT api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/restore`, and to `false` after  `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/save`. Saving the built-in wordmark itself counts as clearing the  setting, so the flag stays `true` in that case as well.

Every logo slot is returned, including the  notification logo that the public list leaves out, so the result has one entry more than that list. An entry  gives the stable slot name in `name` and `default` set to `true` while the slot has never been written, and to  `false` once an image has been stored for it, whether for the light or for the dark theme.

Any authenticated user may call it,  as these details are shown in the interface to everyone; no administrator permission is required. The call is  read-only and idempotent. The list holds the details currently in effect as its first item; when they have  been replaced by a reseller and the replacement is not itself marked as the licensor, the built-in ONLYOFFICE  details are appended as a second item, so a caller can print both the reseller and the original vendor. A  single-item list therefore means that the current details are the only ones to show.

The call is read-only and idempotent. When nothing has been stored for the portal, the  built-in `ONLYOFFICE` is returned, so the answer is never empty and cannot be used to tell a custom text from  the default one - `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/isdefault` answers that question. Pass  `isDefault=true` to read the installation-wide default wordmark instead of this portal's; without it the  portal's own value is returned even when the installation carries a different default.

     * Restore the white label logos
     * Drops every logo uploaded for the current portal and brings back the built-in images, so the portal looks  unbranded again on the login page, in the left menu, in the editors and in letters. Requires a DocSpace  administrator. Unlike the two save operations it does not need a plan that includes branding, so a portal  whose subscription no longer covers it can still be reset. The call is destructive: the stored image files are  deleted and cannot be recovered from the portal, only re-uploaded with  `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/save`. It is idempotent and answers `true` both when logos were  removed and when there was nothing to remove. All slots are reset together; there is no way to restore a  single one. For this portal the picture kept for the older mail templates is reset along with the logos, while  the logo text is left as it is and has its own `PUT api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/restore`. Pass  `isDefault=true` to reset the installation-wide default branding instead, which only a server installation  allows. Confirm the result with `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/isdefault`.
     * Responses:
     *  - 200: Always `true` once the portal shows the built-in logos again
     *  - 403: The caller is not a DocSpace administrator, or the installation does not allow default branding to be edited

     * Stores which of the ONLYOFFICE help and community resources the interface offers: the sample documents, the  Help Center link, the Feedback and Support link, the user forum, the video guides and the license agreements.  The whole set is replaced by the `settings` object of the request, so send every flag, not only the changed  ones - a flag left out is stored as off. A request without that object is rejected as an invalid request.  Requires a DocSpace administrator, a server installation with unrestricted space access and a plan that  includes branding, which `GET api/2.0/settings/enablewhitelabel` reports; on a SaaS portal the call is  refused. The flags are installation-wide, so the change reaches every portal of that installation. The call is  mutating and idempotent, and answers `true`. Only the visibility of these entries is controlled here, not the  addresses behind them. Read the result back with `GET api/2.0/settings/rebranding/additional` and undo it with  `DELETE api/2.0/settings/rebranding/additional`.

Only `logoText` from the request body is used here, and it is limited to 40  characters; a longer value is rejected as an invalid request. Sending an empty or blank text, or exactly the  built-in `ONLYOFFICE`, clears the setting instead of storing it, which has the same effect as  `PUT api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logotext/restore`.

The call is mutating and idempotent: the previous text is overwritten and `true` comes back. Logo  images are not touched - they are saved by `POST api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos/save` - and the text is not  rendered into them.

     * Replaces the branding images of the current portal with the ones sent in the request, so that the logos on the  login page, in the left menu, in the editors and in letters come from this portal. Every entry of `logo` names  a logo slot in its `key` - the numeric type published by `GET api/2.0/settings/whitelabel/logos` - and carries  the light-theme and the dark-theme image in `light` and `dark`. An image is either a  `data:image/png;base64,...` payload (`png`, `jpg` and `svg` are accepted) or the name of a file already  uploaded to the temporary store; a slot left out of the request keeps its image. The dark image is stored only  for the slots that have a dark variant, that is `1`, `2`, `6`, `7` and `8`, and is ignored for the favicon and  the editor logos; saving slot `2` also rebuilds the notification logo `8` from it. Requires a DocSpace  administrator and a plan that includes branding, which `GET api/2.0/settings/enablewhitelabel` reports;  otherwise the call is refused as payment required.
