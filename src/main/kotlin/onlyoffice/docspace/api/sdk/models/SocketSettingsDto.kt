/**
 * Where a client connects for the portal's live updates.

 * @param url The base address of the Socket.IO hub that pushes file changes, presence and quota alerts, always with a  trailing slash. It is empty when the installation runs no hub, and a client must then fall back to  polling rather than guessing an address. The value comes from the installation's configuration and cannot  be changed through this API.
