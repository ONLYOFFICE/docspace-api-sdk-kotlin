/**
 * The body of a file settings switch that turns something on or makes it visible.
 *
 * @param set The state to store for the setting the operation addresses: true enables it or shows what it governs, false  disables or hides it. What exactly is affected, and whether the value belongs to the calling account or to the  whole portal, are stated by the operation that binds this body. The portal may store a different value than  the one sent when another setting overrides it, so read the answer rather than assuming.
