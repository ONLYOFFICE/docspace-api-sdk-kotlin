# EditHistoryDataDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **key** | **kotlin.String** | The document key of the revision being shown, which the editing service uses to identify it and to reuse the  copy it has cached. |  |
| **url** | [**java.net.URI**](java.net.URI.md) | The address the content of this revision is served from. It is meant for the editing service and carries its  own key, which is valid for a limited time. |  |
| **version** | **kotlin.Int** | Echoes the revision that was asked for, so it reports 0 when the request named no version and the current  revision was taken. |  |
| **fileType** | **kotlin.String** | The format of the revision being shown, as an extension without the leading dot. |  |
| **changesUrl** | [**java.net.URI**](java.net.URI.md) | The address the editor downloads the recorded changes of this revision from. It is filled in only when the  portal has a change record for the revision; without it the revision can be shown as a whole document but not  as a set of changes. |  [optional] |
| **previous** | [**EditHistoryUrl**](EditHistoryUrl.md) | The revision this one is compared against. It arrives together with `changesUrl`, and when the revision shown  is the first one the file ever had, it points at the blank template the file was created from instead of at an  earlier revision. |  [optional] |
| **token** | **kotlin.String** | The signature over the whole answer, as a JSON Web Token that the editing service verifies before it accepts  the addresses in it. Empty when the portal runs without a document-service secret. |  [optional] |
