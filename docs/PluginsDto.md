| **enabled** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether web plugins run on this portal at all. While it is `false` the operations under  `api/2.0/settings/webplugins` are of no use, whatever the other two flags say. All three are `false`  unless the installation switched plugins on in its configuration. |  [optional] |
| **upload** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether an administrator may add a plugin of their own through  `POST api/2.0/settings/webplugins`. While it is `false` only the plugins that ship with the installation  are available. |  [optional] |
