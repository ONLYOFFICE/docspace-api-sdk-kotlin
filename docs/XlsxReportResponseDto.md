# XlsxReportResponseDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **form** | [**FileDto**](FileDto.md) | The original form the answers are collected from. It is not the produced spreadsheet - that one arrives with  the task, once the task reports completion. |  [optional] |
| **task** | [**DocumentBuilderTaskDto**](DocumentBuilderTaskDto.md) | The queued generation. Poll it with `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/xlsx` until it reports completion, and  take the produced file from it then. |  [optional] |
| **isNewFile** | **kotlin.Boolean** | True when this run creates the report file, false when an existing report is rewritten in place, which means  it keeps its id and the links already shared for it. |  [optional] |
