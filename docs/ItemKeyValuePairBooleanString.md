## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **key** | **kotlin.Boolean** | The left half of the pair. Where the pair configures something, this is the identifier the value belongs to -  a setting name, a module id, a logo slot; where the pair reports the result of a call, this is the result  itself, such as the flag telling whether the call succeeded. Which of the two it is, and which keys are  accepted, is stated by the operation that sends or returns the pair. |  [optional] |
| **&#x60;value&#x60;** | **kotlin.String** | The right half of the pair: what is assigned to the key next to it, or what is reported for it. Its meaning  and its accepted values follow from the key, so read them from the operation that sends or returns the pair. |  [optional] |
