## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **lang** | **kotlin.String** | The culture the editor interface is shown in, taken from the profile of the caller. |  |
| **mode** | **kotlin.String** | `edit` when this session may write the document, `view` when it may only read it. |  |
| **callbackUrl** | [**java.net.URI**](java.net.URI.md) | Where the editors post the document back to when they save it. A client must not call it itself; it is the  address the document service uses. |  [optional] |
| **coEditing** | [**CoEditingConfig**](CoEditingConfig.md) | How co-editing starts out for this session and whether the user may switch it in the interface. |  [optional] |
| **createUrl** | **kotlin.String** | Where the editor sends the user when they ask for a new document of the same type. It is empty when creating  one is not offered here. |  [optional] |
| **customization** | [**CustomizationConfigDto**](CustomizationConfigDto.md) | How the editor interface is dressed for this portal, this document and this layout. |  [optional] |
| **embedded** | [**EmbeddedConfig**](EmbeddedConfig.md) | The addresses the framed viewer needs. It is filled in only for the embedded layout. |  [optional] |
| **encryptionKeys** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;EncryptionKeyDto&gt;**](EncryptionKeyDto.md) | The caller's end-to-end encryption keys, added only when the document lies in a private room, so that the  editors can decrypt it in the browser. It is empty everywhere else. |  [optional] |
| **modeWrite** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether this session may write; it is what the mode above says in one word. |  [optional] |
| **plugins** | [**PluginsConfig**](PluginsConfig.md) | Which editor plugins are offered. The portal currently offers none, so the list inside comes back empty. |  [optional] |
| **recent** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;RecentConfig&gt;**](RecentConfig.md) | The documents offered in the editor's recent list. It is left out altogether when there is nothing to offer. |  [optional] |
| **templates** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;TemplatesConfig&gt;**](TemplatesConfig.md) | Always empty: the portal no longer passes creation templates through the editor configuration. |  [optional] |
| **user** | [**UserConfig**](UserConfig.md) | The account the editors attribute changes to. It is empty for an anonymous session opened through an external  link, and the editors then ask for a name themselves. |  [optional] |
