# MigrationStatusDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **progress** | **kotlin.Double** | The share of the job that is done, from 0 to 100. It advances unevenly, since the stages differ in  length, so poll `isCompleted` rather than waiting for this to reach 100. |  [optional] |
| **error** | **kotlin.String** | The message that ended the job, in the portal language. It stays empty while nothing has gone wrong, so  once `isCompleted` is `true` this field is what tells success from failure. |  [optional] |
| **parseResult** | [**MigrationApiInfo**](MigrationApiInfo.md) | What the migrator has read so far. After a parse pass it holds the users, the groups and the archives it  could not read, which is the body to edit and post to `POST api/2.0/migration/migrate`; during an import it  also carries the accounts that were created and the ones that failed. Its own `operation` field, `parse`  or `migration`, is what tells the two stages apart. |  [optional] |
| **isCompleted** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the job has stopped, successfully or not. It is the field to poll on; the whole body comes back  empty instead when the portal has no job at all, which is not an error. |  [optional] |
