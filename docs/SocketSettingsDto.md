## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **url** | **kotlin.String** | The base address of the Socket.IO hub that pushes file changes, presence and quota alerts, always with a  trailing slash. It is empty when the installation runs no hub, and a client must then fall back to  polling rather than guessing an address. The value comes from the installation's configuration and cannot  be changed through this API. |  [optional] |
