## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **room** | [**FileEntryBaseDto**](FileEntryBaseDto.md) | The room the entries were found in, in its short form: only the identifier, the title, the room type and the  logo are filled in. |  [optional] |
| **items** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;FileEntryBaseDto&gt;**](FileEntryBaseDto.md) | The files of that room the caller has not opened yet, the most recently changed first. Reading them here does  not clear the badges; opening the room itself does. |  [optional] |
