## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **module** | **kotlin.String** | The storage provider to switch to, by the identifier the matching listing operation reports - `default` for  the built-in local storage. The provider has to be available on the server, which that listing reports as  `isSet`, otherwise the request is refused with 400; sending the module already in use changes nothing. |  |
| **props** | [**kotlin.collections.List&lt;ItemKeyValuePairStringString&gt;**](ItemKeyValuePairStringString.md) | The credentials the provider expects, as the name and value pairs it defines - a bucket, a region and an  access key for an Amazon S3 storage, for instance. Read the expected names from the entry of that provider in  the listing operation; they differ per provider, so there is no fixed set. |  [optional] |
