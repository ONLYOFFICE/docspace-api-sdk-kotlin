# FolderLinkRequest

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **linkId** | [**java.util.UUID**](java.util.UUID.md) | Which link the request addresses: the identifier of an existing link rewrites that link, while an identifier  that is not in use, the empty one included, creates a new link. Take an existing identifier from  `GET api/2.0/files/folder/{id}/links`. |  [optional] |
| **access** | [**FileShare**](FileShare.md) | The rights a visitor following the link is given. The value that grants nothing revokes the link instead of  setting it, and the answer is then empty. |  [optional] |
| **expirationDate** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | The moment the link stops working, sent as an ISO-8601 stamp. A moment that lies in the past is ignored,  and leaving the field out gives the link no expiry. |  [optional] |
| **title** | **kotlin.String** | The name the link is listed under for the people who manage the folder; a visitor following it never sees the  name. |  [optional] |
| **password** | **kotlin.String** | The secret a visitor has to enter before the link opens. Leave it out for a link that opens without one; the  secret itself is never given back, only the fact that one is set. |  [optional] |
| **denyDownload** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether visitors are left with viewing alone: with true downloading and copying through the link are blocked,  with false they are allowed. |  [optional] |
| **&#x60;internal&#x60;** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the link admits signed-in portal members only: with true a visitor has to sign in before the link  opens, with false anyone holding the address may follow it. |  [optional] |
| **primary** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether this link becomes the primary link of the folder, the one the Copy link action of a client hands  out; a folder has one primary link at a time. |  [optional] |
