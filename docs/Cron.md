## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **period** | [**BackupPeriod**](BackupPeriod.md) | How often the backup runs: `EveryDay`, `EveryWeek` or `EveryMonth`. It defaults to `EveryDay`. |  [optional] |
| **hour** | **kotlin.Int** | The hour of the day the backup starts at, from 0 to 23. Minutes cannot be chosen - it always starts  on the hour. |  [optional] |
| **day** | **kotlin.Int** | The day the backup runs on: the day of the week from 1 to 7, Sunday being 1, for `EveryWeek`, and the  day of the month from 1 to 31 for `EveryMonth`. Leave it out for `EveryDay` only - an omitted value is  stored as 0, which neither of the other two periods accepts, so a weekly or monthly schedule sent  without it fails. |  [optional] |
