# TariffQuotaDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **id** | **kotlin.Int** | The quota this entry stands for. `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/quotas` describes the quota behind the ID,  including what its `quantity` counts; a negative ID belongs to a built-in quota rather than a purchased  one. |  [optional] |
| **quantity** | **kotlin.Int** | How much of the quota the portal holds, in whatever the quota itself is measured in - seats for a plan,  gigabytes for storage. It is `1` for a quota that is simply on or off. |  [optional] |
| **wallet** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the quota is paid for out of the portal wallet as it is consumed, rather than being part of the  subscription charged per period. |  [optional] |
| **additional** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether this is an add-on bought on top of the plan rather than the plan itself. Exactly one entry of  `quotas` is the plan, and the rest are add-ons. |  [optional] |
| **dueDate** | [**ApiDateTime**](ApiDateTime.md) | When this quota runs out, in the portal time zone. An add-on can end earlier or later than the  subscription; a quota with no deadline of its own reports the subscription's `dueDate` instead of an empty  value. |  [optional] |
| **nextQuantity** | **kotlin.Int** | The quantity the next period is going to be charged for, when a change has been scheduled. It is empty  while `quantity` simply carries over. |  [optional] |
| **nextQuota** | **kotlin.Int** | The quota this one is scheduled to be replaced by at the start of the next period, empty when no such  switch is planned. `GET api/2.0/portal/tariff/upcoming` already reports the charge for the replacement. |  [optional] |
| **state** | [**QuotaState**](QuotaState.md) | Whether the quota is still running or its deadline has passed. It is empty for a quota that has no  deadline of its own, which means it lasts as long as the subscription does. |  [optional] |
