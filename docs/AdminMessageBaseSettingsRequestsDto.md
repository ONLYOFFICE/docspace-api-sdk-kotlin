## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **email** | **kotlin.String** | The address the join link is sent to. It has to be a well-formed ASCII address rather than an  internationalized one, must not already belong to a member of the portal, and, where the portal trusts named  domains only, has to end with one of them; any of these faults is refused with 400. |  |
| **culture** | **kotlin.String** | The language the letter is written in, as a culture name such as `en-US`. A culture the installation does not  have falls back to the portal language rather than failing the call. |  [optional] |
