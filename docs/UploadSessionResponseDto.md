# UploadSessionResponseDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **id** | **kotlin.Int** | The file the parts are being written into. An upload that took over a file of the same title carries it from  the start, while an upload that creates a new file has nothing to name yet and reports 0 until the answer that  sets `uploaded` to true. |  [optional] |
| **folderId** | **kotlin.Int** | The folder receiving the file. It is the folder the upload was reserved against, or the sub-folder created for  it when the reservation declared a relative path. |  [optional] |
| **version** | **kotlin.Int** | The revision the content is being written as: 1 for a file that did not exist, the next number when the upload  took over a file of the same title, and the unchanged current number for an upload opened over an existing  file, which replaces its content in place. |  [optional] |
| **title** | **kotlin.String** | The title the file is stored under, after characters a title cannot hold were replaced and, where a second  copy was asked for, a numeric suffix was added - so it can differ from the name that was sent. |  [optional] |
| **providerKey** | **kotlin.String** | The third-party service holding the destination, such as `GoogleDrive` or `OneDrive`, and null for a folder  stored on the portal itself. |  [optional] |
| **uploaded** | **kotlin.Boolean** | False while bytes are still missing, when the answer only reports progress; true in the answer that reports  the stored file, which is also the answer that arrives with 201. |  [optional] |
| **file** | [**FileDto**](FileDto.md) | The file as it stands. It is filled in both answers, but while `uploaded` is false it describes a file that  has not been written yet, so its identifier, size and links are only worth reading once that flag turns true. |  [optional] |
