## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **version** | **kotlin.Int** | The version the comment belongs to, as reported by `GET api/2.0/files/file/{fileId}/edit/history`. A version  that does not exist is rejected as an invalid request. |  |
| **comment** | **kotlin.String** | The note that explains what changed in that version, as the version history shows it. An empty text clears the  note, and a longer one is cut rather than refused, so read the stored text from the answer. |  [optional] |
