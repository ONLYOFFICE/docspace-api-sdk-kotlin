# **getThirdPartyCode**
> StringWrapper getThirdPartyCode (LoginProvider provider)

Builds and returns, as a string, the OAuth 2.0 consent URL of one external provider - the address a client  opens in a browser so that the user can grant this portal access to their account. The provider's client id,  secret and redirect URI have to be saved for the portal first with `POST api/2.0/settings/authservice`;  without them the URL has no `client_id` and the provider refuses it. Any signed-in portal user may call it,  and the call is read-only and safe to repeat. The URL carries `response_type=code`, the portal's `client_id`,  the provider's `redirect_uri`, the scope the portal needs (Drive with offline access for Google, `signature`  for DocuSign) and a `state` pointing back at this portal's `thirdparty/{provider}/code` page, where the code  arrives in the URL fragment as `#code=...`, or `#error/...` when the user declines. Only Google `1`, Dropbox  `2`, Docusign `3`, Box `4`, OneDrive `5`, Wordpress `10` and Github `13` produce a URL; any other value is  answered with 200 and no URL instead of an error. With `desktop=true`, the whole query string is copied into  `state` and comes back on the callback. The code is not exchanged here: pass it on as `token` to  `POST api/2.0/files/thirdparty` to connect the account.
