# WebhookTriggerDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **name** | **kotlin.String** | The event name exactly as it appears in a delivered payload, so a receiver can match on it. The entry  named `*` is not an event but the catch-all. |  [optional] |
| **id** | **kotlin.Long** | The bit that stands for this event in the `triggers` bitmask of a subscription. Add the bits of the wanted  events together; the catch-all entry has the value `0` and is used on its own rather than added to  anything. |  [optional] |
| **available** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the caller's own role may subscribe to this event - a plain member cannot subscribe to user, group  or room creation, where a room administrator can. An unavailable event is listed all the same, and sending  its bit to `POST api/2.0/settings/webhook` is refused as an invalid request. |  [optional] |
