## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **code** | **kotlin.String** | The code to check - either one from the authenticator application or one of the account's unused backup  codes, which is spent by the check. A wrong code is refused with 400 and counts against the portal login  attempt limit. |  |
| **session** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the sign-in that follows is tied to the browser session. When it is, the session ends with the  browser rather than lasting for the portal session lifetime. |  [optional] |
