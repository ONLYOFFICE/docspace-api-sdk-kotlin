# BatchTagsRequestDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **names** | **kotlin.collections.List&lt;kotlin.String&gt;** | The tags, by name: a tag has no identifier of its own, and the name is what links a room to it.  `GET api/2.0/files/tags` lists the names already in the portal catalogue. An empty list is accepted and does  nothing, while a blank or overlong entry makes the whole request invalid. |  |
