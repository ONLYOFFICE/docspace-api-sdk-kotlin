## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **serviceName** | **kotlin.collections.List&lt;kotlin.String&gt;** | The wallet services whose consumption is reported, named the way the billing catalogue names them -  `backup`, `ai-tools`, `ai-search`, `disk-storage`, `docscloud`. Take the values from the `serviceName` field  of `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/walletservices`; the match ignores case, a name this installation does not  sell fails the call with 404, and an omitted list reports every service. A bare string is accepted in place  of an array for backward compatibility. |  [optional] |
| **startDate** | [**java.time.OffsetDateTime**](java.time.OffsetDateTime.md) | The beginning of the reported period, inclusive. Read in the portal time zone rather than in UTC, and  defaults to the portal creation date. |  [optional] |
| **endDate** | [**java.time.OffsetDateTime**](java.time.OffsetDateTime.md) | The end of the reported period, inclusive. Read in the portal time zone rather than in UTC, and defaults to  the moment the call is made. |  [optional] |
| **participantName** | **kotlin.String** | The participant whose consumption is reported - the account the accounting service records as the consumer.  Consumption caused by a portal user carries that user ID here; surrounding whitespace is trimmed, and an  omitted value reports every participant. |  [optional] |
| **status** | [**OperationStatus**](OperationStatus.md) | The outcome to keep. Consumption that is still being settled is reported as pending and may change later,  while the other outcomes are final; every outcome is reported when this is omitted. |  [optional] |
| **metadata** | **kotlin.collections.Map&lt;kotlin.String, kotlin.String?&gt;** | The usage annotations a wallet service records alongside its consumption, as the key and value pairs that  must all match for a record to be reported. The keys are chosen by the service that writes them, so read  them off the `metadata` of the records returned by `GET api/2.0/portal/payment/customer/usage` rather than  guessing; an omitted map reports every record. |  [optional] |
| **orderBy** | **kotlin.String** | The name of the field the per-service totals are sorted by, spelled as the accounting service names it, such  as `ServiceName` or `StartDate`. Surrounding whitespace is trimmed, and the accounting service applies its  own ordering when this is omitted. |  [optional] |
| **orderType** | [**OperationOrderType**](OperationOrderType.md) | The direction the field named in `orderBy` is sorted in. Newest or largest first is what the accounting  service does by default, so leaving this out sorts the same way as asking for descending explicitly. |  [optional] |
