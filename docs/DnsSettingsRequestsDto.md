## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **dnsName** | **kotlin.String** | The domain the portal is to be reachable under, as a bare hostname without a scheme. It must not collide with  the reserved base domain of the installation, and a name that fails validation is refused without disturbing  the mapping in force. It is read only while `enable` is true. |  [optional] |
| **enable** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the custom domain is put in force. Setting it false clears the mapping and ignores `dnsName`; setting  it true also stops the previous domain from answering and rewrites any Content Security Policy entry that  named it. |  [optional] |
