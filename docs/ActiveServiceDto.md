## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **service** | **kotlin.String** | The stable key of the service, which is what `POST api/2.0/portal/payment/servicestate` takes to switch  it off again. |  [optional] |
| **serviceUnit** | **kotlin.String** | What `limit` and `used` count, in the portal language - gigabytes, editor seats, credits. |  [optional] |
| **subscription** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether the service is billed as a standing subscription rather than per unit consumed. Only a  subscription can carry `limit` and `used`. |  [optional] |
| **title** | **kotlin.String** | The service name in the portal language, for printing rather than matching. |  [optional] |
| **limit** | **kotlin.Int** | How much of the service the portal is entitled to. It is empty for a service whose consumption is not  counted this way, which is not the same as a service without a limit. |  [optional] |
| **used** | **kotlin.Int** | How much of that allowance is in use - the editors currently active for the cloud editors, the units  already consumed for disk storage. Empty under the same conditions as `limit`. |  [optional] |
