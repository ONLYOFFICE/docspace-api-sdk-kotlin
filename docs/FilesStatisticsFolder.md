## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **title** | **kotlin.String** | The name of the section as the interface shows it, translated into the language used by the caller, so it  suits display but not matching - which section an entry describes is told by the field that carries it. |  [optional] |
| **usedSpace** | **kotlin.Long** | The size of the files kept in the section, in bytes, counting every folder and room inside it; 0 means the  section holds nothing. The counter is brought up to date as an operation finishes, so a reading taken right  after an upload or a delete can still show the previous value. |  [optional] |
