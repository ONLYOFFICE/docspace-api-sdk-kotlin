## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **message** | **kotlin.String** | What the sender wants to tell the portal administrators. Markup is stripped before the letter is written, so  a body that carries nothing but markup counts as empty and is refused with 400. |  |
| **email** | **kotlin.String** | The address the sender can be answered at, which the letter is signed with. It has to be a well-formed email  address. |  |
| **culture** | **kotlin.String** | The language the letter is written in, as a culture name such as `en-US`. A culture the installation does not  have falls back to the portal language rather than failing the call. |  [optional] |
| **recaptchaType** | [**RecaptchaType**](RecaptchaType.md) | Which CAPTCHA service the proof in `recaptchaResponse` came from. It has to match the service the  installation is configured with, which `GET api/2.0/capabilities` reports; the default value means the  installation is left to decide. |  [optional] |
| **recaptchaResponse** | **kotlin.String** | The token the CAPTCHA widget produced in the browser, passed on unchanged for the portal to verify with the  CAPTCHA service. It is single-use and short-lived, so it cannot be reused for a second message. |  [optional] |
