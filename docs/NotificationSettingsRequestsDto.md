# NotificationSettingsRequestsDto

## Properties
| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **type** | [**NotificationType**](NotificationType.md) | The kind of notification being switched. A value outside the defined set is echoed back while nothing is  stored, so confirm the result with `GET api/2.0/settings/notification/{type}` rather than trusting the  answer. |  |
| **isEnabled** | **kotlin.Boolean** | Whether that kind reaches the calling account. It applies to the caller own account alone and to every room  at once; a single room is silenced with `POST api/2.0/settings/notification/rooms` instead. |  [optional] |
